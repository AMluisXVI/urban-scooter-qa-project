## 🗂️ Analysis & Planning Phase

Before writing a single test, a thorough requirements analysis was conducted to break down the application's core functionality.  
A mind map was created as a visual tool to illustrate user flows, interdependencies, and critical test areas.

## 📁 Repository Content & Structure

The project is organized into the following directories to ensure clear and logical navigation of all test assets:

---

### 📄 `/docs`

This folder centralizes all foundational project documentation.  
It includes:

- Requirements documents (for back-end, web, and mobile applications) used as the basis for all testing.
- The visual mind map detailing the analysis and strategy.

### 🧪 `/test-artifacts`

The heart of the QA work.  
Contains all testing materials designed and executed throughout the project, including:

- **Test Cases:**  
  Comprehensive documents with functional tests for the web app, mobile app, and APIs.
- **SQL Queries:**  
  Scripts used to query the database and verify that records were created, updated, and deleted correctly as a result of user actions.

---

### 🐞 `/bug-reports`

A dedicated directory documenting all defects, errors, and issues identified during the test cycles.  
Each file in this folder represents an individual bug report, following a professional template to ensure clarity and reproducibility by the development team.
